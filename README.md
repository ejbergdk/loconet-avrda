# loconet-avrda
Experimental library providing LocoNet communication on AVR DA processors.

This library is used for ongoing tests and experiments of interfacing a Microchip AVR DA processor to a LocoNet bus, using as little hardware as possible.
See the [project homepage](https://www.ejberg.dk/portfolio/loconet-avr-da/) for more information.

Yes, I know. Documentation is non-existent right now. Work is in progress.
